# key-logger

This is a key logger built from scratch using C++ 

 ## Note :
 * This program is only created for educational and learning purposes.
 * This keylogger can cause serious damage so use it for good, for learning and in a legal and responsible way.
 * This program should never be used in an illegal way (hacking someone ...).

 ## TODO :
 * The command in SendMail.cpp, line 88 (std::string param ) is
 not working. See how to send email with C++ silently.
